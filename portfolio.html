          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hi, my name is Alex Norrell! <br>I am 30 years old and am attending 
               classes through Georgia Tech to become a full stack programmer.
                When I am not doing that I am either working with dogs or playing 
                music with my band. </p>

               <p>I am currently employed at a doggy day care, 
                    where I take care of many lovely pups. 
                    Most day I am at the front desk doing reception 
                    work but on days when I get lucky I got to go and 
                    play with some absolutely amazing dogs and make sure 
                    they are having an amazing time when they are staying with us. </p>

                    <p>I am a semi professional musician. 
                         I tour all around the country with my band 
                         Glimmers. We have played everywhere from Los
                          Angeles to New Orleans to Milwaukee to Nashville. 
                          It's a hard thing to do but I love it and will 
                          keep doing it for as long as I can. </p>

                    <p>I am currently enrolled in a full stack coding boot

                         further my career and so I can be able to have more 
                         opportunities to make life better for myself and those 
                         around me. Its a lot of hours and is very stressful but 
                         it will get me where I need to go in life. </p>
